# Comparison of RSSW predicted proteins to boll weevil

We have >50,000 predicted proteins form BRAKER2, which seems like way too much. Working hypothesis is that between the fragmented assembly and low RNA-Seq coverage, BRAKER2 is producing a lot of split genes. To test this compare the number and length distribtions of proteins from RSSW and boll weevil.

Boll weevil proteins come from the NCBI reference genome. Analysis is in the R notebook. Summary: the hypothesis is supported, RSSW has about twice as many predicted proteins as boll weevil, but the RSSW predicted proteins are much smaller.
